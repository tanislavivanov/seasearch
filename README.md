+ About seaSearch™:
	+ seaSearch™ is a PHP powered search engine that uses keywords to show results. It has a fully working Search Console called the "seaSearch™ Console" that lists existing entries and also has a system that can add and delete entries from/to the database.

+ How did it happen?:
	+ seaSearch™ was created as a project that was aimed to work as a per-site search system but turned out to be a fully working search engine like Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, and others.

More information will soon be posted on the official website which is currently being developed. Updates are constantly pushed. Please report any issues via GitHub.
